// The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940's for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±

// It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

// Yes - definitely.
// It is decidedly so.
// Without a doubt.
// Reply hazy, try again.
// Ask again later.
// Better not tell you now.
// My sources say no.
// Outlook not so good.
// Very doubtful.
// Create a magic8.js program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

// The output should have the following format:

// Question:       [Question]
// Magic 8 Ball:   [Answer]

// For example:

// Question:       Is CodÃ©dex better than Udemy yet?
// Magic 8 Ball:   Better not tell you now.
